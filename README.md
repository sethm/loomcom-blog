# Loom Communicatons Blogging System

This is a very basic Emacs package that provides a single function,
`loomcom-blog-new`, that will open a new, correctly-numbered weblog
entry for the Loom Communications blog.

I cannot imagine this being useful for anyone but myself, but if
you're interested in stealing any part of it, please do!
